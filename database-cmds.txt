The following sql commands are used to setup the database
from which text information is widthdrawn and into which
the updated n_times_summarized values are written. n_times_summarized
reflects how often a summarization for a particular text has been
submitted, so the chance for are particular text to be shown on the
page upon opening the page can be negatively weighted. Thus, texts that
haven't been summarized so often have a greater chance of being displayed,
and thus, being summarized.



## INIT DATABASE:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS text_infos (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
file_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
headline VARCHAR(255),
target_length INTEGER,
n_times_summarized INTEGER);



## INSER ROWS:

INSERT INTO text_infos (file_name, headline, target_length, n_times_summarized)
VALUES
('ABBA.txt', 'Text: ABBA', 180, 0),
('Buch.txt', 'Text: Buch', 225, 0),
('Chor.txt', 'Text: Chor', 150, 0),
('Faultier.txt', 'Text: Faultier', 280, 0),
('Globus.txt', 'Text: Globus', 180, 0);
